# Scene with light measurement :

- Growth chamber:
  - Rose (Jessica) : PO, Geoemetry, Lamp, PAR Sensors, Ref simulation
  - Palm tree (ecotron) : Archi Lidar, No PO, Lamp, Sensors
     - Requires calibration for PO and Lamp position
- Field measurement:
  -  Mango tree : Archi, PO, PAR Sensors, GHI (2 month)
      - Leaf position and size are characterized by rules, No diffuse
  - Maize : Archi (skeleton+ planar leaf shape), PAR Sensors, GHI
      - No PO, No diffuse
  - Vine : Archi (with leaf), PAR Sensors, Weather (direct and diffuse ?)
      - No PO
  - Walnut : Archi (no leaf), Sensors ?
      - Requires explanation
  - Grass land ? : Scan, Archi reconstruction, directional sensors next to the plant,
      - Sensors gives information on plant reflectance      

# Theoretical scene
- polygon soup
- measured voxel soup
- regular/homogeneous annual crop (maize, wheat (adel or digitized) / L-egume)
   -  dynamics
   -  early stage to test heterogeneity of plant distribution
- measured crop (phenoarch maize)
   - volumetric mesh, dynamic, with digitized greenhouse
- tree like plants (vine, palm tree, apple tree, mango tree)
- intercroping (pea + wheat, alfalfa + tall fescue, white clover + tall fescue, wheat + alfalfa)
- agroforetry (cocoa tree (measured) + banana (),  eucalyptus (?), rubber tree (?), palm tree (simulated) + rice)
   - to build
