# Scales:
  - Temporal: snapshot or integration over the day (or other)
  - Spatial: sensor, organ, plant, branch / twig (in the case of a tree)?, entire scene / canopy.

# Variables:
  - Sensors -> illumination / irradiance
  - No sensors -> absorption and irradiance
  - Per unit area
  - Scattering: to compare models with each other, separate the first order and scattering.
  - Definition of wavelength bands, e.g., in extreme bands where there may be a lot of reradiation or infrared...
  - Application to photomorphogenesis: directional radiation. Can the models output this? Are there data available?

# CritÃ¨res:
## Calculation
  - Ref: 1 CPU, on a single machine
  - Parallelization: scale up to how many processors?
  - GPU? Does it work?
  - Up to what complexity can we go with which model
  - Allows justifying the choice of a model based on available resources
    Evaluation on scenes integrated over time or snapshot

## Evaluation ofr sensor measurements:
  - RMSEp and biais, model efficiency
  - other ?

## Generic

  - Dispersion criteria: "relative distance RDP" (?) -> allows seeing if a model is really different from others
  - Dispersion
      At the organ scale:
        Specify the situation in the scene: + / - high or low in the canopy,
        Depending on the orientation of the organ
    Sensitivity of models to certain parameters
        Sky
        Optical properties
        Structure

## Resolution
  - Conduct a sensitivity study on resolution and link it with computation time.
